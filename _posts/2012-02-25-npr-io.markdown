Introducing [NPR.io][nprio], the fatest way to get straight to the news.

## Why?

The NPR iOS app takes too many clicks to just get to a playlist of the latest show like All Things Considered or Morning Edition. With [NPR.io][nprio], you're one click away from hourly news and the most recent show; after that it plays through all of the stories. Each story you play all the way through is tracked locally so will be automatically skipped next time.

## How

NPR.io is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) app written in CoffeeScript, deployed to Amazon S3, fronted by CloudFront. That means it *should* never go down.

It uses the [NPR API](http://www.npr.org/api/queryGenerator.php) to get the latest shows, and localStorage to keep track of your settings and plays.

## Notes

* iOS Safari:
  * HTML5 audio won't autoplay without a user click, so the page loads with a clickable overlay.
  * you can use the built in iOS play/next/previous buttons on the lock screen
* no FireFox support yet, since FF does not support mp3 in HTML5 audio.
* thank you Lee Donahoe for the app icon!

## Todos

* push state for forward / back navigation
